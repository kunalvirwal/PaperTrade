# syntax error
This is my project PaperTrade which I made for Syntax Error 2023.<br>
It is a Tkinter based GUI application which shows live prices of all the stocks listed on NSE and any other stock exchange.<br>
It also fetches the data of last 27 years  of daily opening and closing price of many stocks and displays their life time graph.<br>
This program also allows users to trade real time with fake money which can be used to teach people, how to enter the field of Stocks and Trading.
